# Progress Report - Milestone 2b

**What tasks has each group member been assigned to for Milestone 2. What has each group member done since the submission of Milestone 1.**

For milestone 2B we have delegated the tasks between the group members. 

Caitlin Lau is in charge of coding the main structure of the code. Caitlin will focus on debugging and coding the structure of the code. Since Milestone 1, Caitlin has made any suggested changes from the teaching staff, such as adding a LICENSE file, and creating the code structure scaffold for the project. 

Lu Yu is in charge of understanding the object orientated structure of the project, implementing and testing the project, and uploading the package onto distribution platforms. Since Milestone 1, Lu helped set up the Travis CI software and test with Caitlin and worked on the documentation in Milestone one. Lu did research on the mathematical background and concepts related to automatic differentiation.

Mason is in charge of setting up TravisCI testing software for the main implementation of our code. He also contributed to the development of the forward differentiation code with his group members. Since milestone 1, Mason has reviewed relevant materials, done research on Forward differentiation and [Mason Burlage](mailto:mburlage@college.harvard.edu) will focus on the development of our software, helping with expanding our codebase further to a fully functioning forward differentiating code during the group’s pair-programming meetings. Moreover, Mason will contribute to the testing of our software using Travis CI and codecov. 

Jailyn Clark is in charge of doing the mathematical structure of the Jacobian and forward differentiation. Jailyn will research and understand in depth what needs to be implemented mathematically to ensure that our package has robust mathematical applications. Since milestone 1, Jailyn has made tweaks to the README file and debriefed the team on what changes need to be made. Jailyn has also done extensive research on the Jacobian and Newton’s for the project.
